**SHL Assessment Recommendation System**

This project is a job-description-to-assessment matching engine that helps recommend the most relevant SHL Individual Test Solutions based on job descriptions or free-form queries. It uses a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Sentence-BERT, and a scoring mechanism to generate top-matching assessments.
